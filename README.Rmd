# ecoscope

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ecoscope is to learn how to make R packages

The goal of ecoscope is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of ecoscope like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is an example fo the use case for the ecoscope package!!!

```{r example}
library(ecoscope)

#single numeric vector
square1(3)
cube1(3)

#vectors

square1(1:5)
cube1(1:5)

#lists, just square(x)

square1(list(1,2,3))

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
